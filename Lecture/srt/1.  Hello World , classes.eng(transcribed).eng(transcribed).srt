1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,360
okay so we started recording everything

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,560
is fine I

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,080
hope

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,280
chat no okay good so if there's any

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,240
problem you guys if you see in the chat

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,199
there's a problem just let me know okay

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,880
so now we're going to start our slides

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
oh why is that not working it just

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
worked

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,720
right

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
somehow what happened

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,759
there

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,840
I didn't do anything in work last time

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,360
so I didn't do anything special last

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,440
time check table and store this to

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,919
sleep that

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
hey all right it's

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,720
not same level

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,039
with2 that's

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,280
4.11 I'm sure the number have being

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,079
higher without the occasional presses in

22
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,840
the f

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,360
1.1.9

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,920
which was distributed on the delivery

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
start dat as well as small

26
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,640
non-waterproof batch from the

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
first

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,479
I I'm trying to who is talking this guy

29
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,719
let's

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,880
mute no size fits the majority of

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,520
respondents which is lifting the number

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,719
increased by 4.

33
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
8% hello somebody who's talking please

34
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,360
mute yourself I know that I can ask to M

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
oh see this guy I cannot

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,080
mute I cannot mute him there is no

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,200
option well I think that guy is not

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
connected to voice anyway oh that he is

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,040
connecting so somebody else is talking

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
okay I think they muted okay is it time

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,959
to start no not yet so let me hide this

42
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,959
thing it's too big I don't have much

43
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,959
space here just have extra windows and

44
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,000
let's start

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,720
with oh

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
that's that's in the

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,280
way so we'll start with

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,920
this and we're going to do slider.com

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,000
okay you remember to record I'm

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,280
recording already okay thank you that's

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,519
very

52
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,440
important and how many people do you

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,879
have online 20 and well hey it's not

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,840
full room so we're

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,879
good oh yeah I need annotation as

56
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,920
well I need

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,680
annotation and now I need to present

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,760
with speaker notes because

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,599
otherwise it gohost

60
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,280
okay I think it's there

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,720
there you

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,200
go where can I get the zoom

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,120
link I sent M

64
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,640
email it's the same one as I usually use

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,439
it's my personal can you find it

66
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,560
somewhere

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,519
else in some

68
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,400
chats this is a very

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
small

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
[Music]

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,319
okay okay

72
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,159
okay so I gave you this handouts this is

73
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,079
for the actual lecture so we'll start

74
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,159
with just introduction to the course

75
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,639
then we'll use this and I realized that

76
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,478
my version is so bad last night it felt

77
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,399
like I just don't see

78
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,440
because but now in bright I

79
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,120
see but the idea is that you'll pill out

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,919
whatever you can okay so we will have to

81
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,400
understand everything that slide and

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
it's first lecture that's our goal if

83
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
you don't see something and don't

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,320
understand what you're discussing just

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
ask and let me see

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
here okay so let's start we'll start

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
with some introductions so my name is

88
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Anna laala I've seen many familiar faces

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,039
so many of you have taken course with me

90
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,160
before probably was virtual reality

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,400
course of some sort but this is

92
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,320
something new and yet old so I'm going

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,400
to be teaching this term the course and

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
um why I'm going to teach it so let's

95
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,240
see my background I got PhD in 2008 from

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
un of Illinois at champ and uh my PG

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,520
topics were in robotics motion training

98
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,000
and lat VR but I also taught for two

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,520
years this c+1 over there um and I had a

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
great mentor who developed this course

101
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,440
and helped me start there and um it was

102
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,240
a great it was a very good very popular

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,160
later on I also was a research stist at

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,360
Oculus VR so I had a chance to actually

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,080
write code in C++ so I would say

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,360
throughout my academic

107
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,319
years industry experience it was more

108
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,600
than a decade that I used C++ on daily

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
basis um since then then I

110
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,680
have um but nevertheless this is some

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,319
picture from my PD years I worked on um

112
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,639
uniform distributions of quan that was

113
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,840
useful for uh VR as well writing had

114
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,280
tracking code for virtual reality at

115
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,160
Oculus it was very useful in C++ so I

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,639
will not be doing it alone we will have

117
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
here El Ando helping they our teaching

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,280
assistants and uh I want you guys to

119
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,639
introduce yourself as well as usual the

120
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,680
same thing so what like why are you here

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,919
why do you want to

122
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,560
C++ uh yeah hey and uh yeah I'm I'm

123
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,599
working at the University teacher here I

124
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,800
I was teaching the mobile Computing

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,720
course last year and I've been working

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,400
on this C++ course as well developing

127
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,240
the like Auto graders for the exercises

128
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
uh you're going to be working on as well

129
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,680
as like developing like a new exercise

130
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,360
entirely and yeah I've always like liked

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
C++ I it was actually the first

132
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,879
programming language I started with

133
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,360
so yeah I'm looking forward

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,759
to working here on this course yeah so

135
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,800
these guys are uh going to be more help

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,599
for you with debugging your homework

137
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,800
because I'll be probably more

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,879
concentrated on preparing the lectures

139
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,199
each lecture is kind of a nice story and

140
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,080
it's very important to remember where to

141
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
turn otherwise it will the story will

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
break so that takes some time and I

143
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,159
really encourage you to come to lectures

144
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,319
because they are fun they they are these

145
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,720
nice stories um but then there is a lot

146
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,759
of work that you guys will have to do in

147
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,039
teams for your lab assignments and

148
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,879
individually for your machine problems

149
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,240
and uh we'll have a lot of support for

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,159
you with debugging and El Ando that's

151
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,440
their main job to help

152
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
you the t

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,120
is uh also going to be on board as our

154
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,930
TA

155
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,040
[Music]

156
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,720
so yeah hello everyone my name is I'm

157
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,919
Bachelor student here and I will be

158
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,240
helping you mainly during the lab

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,479
any questions you might have about

160
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,000
General

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,279
I I am part of CA because I helped with

162
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,040
debugging the exercise last fall and

163
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
otherwise I just and I just asked me to

164
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,080
be here so now yes so so these guys are

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
experienced

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,680
Tas and um they have been helping me

167
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,360
with other courses for many years now El

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,399
how many years has it been

169
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,959
five since

170
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,279
2019 and like two already two years yeah

171
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,519
so so they know what they're doing uh

172
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
but this is all new to all of us in some

173
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
way in some sense so let's see how it

174
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,600
goes this is supposed to be a pilot

175
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,800
course and I'll explain uh later in more

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,399
details why

177
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,880
now something exciting is

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
happening um this course seem to be

179
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,160
important not only because hey we

180
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,399
decided to teach it actually we didn't

181
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,839
decide to teach it we kind of were

182
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,040
pushed in some way because there's a big

183
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,839
need in loc in our community here for

184
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,519
you guys to learn sequence plus so these

185
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,399
companies were all over us for the last

186
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,120
year um kind of encouraging us to start

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,640
as course so we talking about fute

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,360
mainly but also C no and El so we are in

189
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,000
communication with them and even more

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,240
excitingly five members of cute will be

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
helping you guys on this score they're

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,640
already there with deing your homeworks

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,279
as well not only us but also those

194
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,160
person and moreover one person from

195
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,040
cute right did I say it right v l he is

196
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,160
largest Ser programmer um but he's also

197
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,959
a member of the C++ senate committee um

198
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,519
so he knows C++ in and out and you know

199
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,639
he goes to those meetings and decides

200
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,320
what should be the next um release of

201
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,720
C++ so he'll be there so that's really

202
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,639
exciting he also will come as an invited

203
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,160
lecturer for one of our lectures in

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
April sometime I already put it as an

205
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,519
enlighted lecture by him so please mark

206
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,160
the date and come because I think I'm

207
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,519
sure that will be very interesting so

208
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,360
here's full disclosure I think I already

209
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,040
mentioned that I cannot say that I'm an

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
expert on c i don't practice C++ every

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,519
day

212
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,800
anymore which means so what is the

213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,920
implication for this course I may just

214
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,639
not know really and that's why it's so

215
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,600
important for us to have those guys

216
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
because if there's any question that you

217
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,200
can have that we can figure out we have

218
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
to have a list of questions for those

219
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,880
guys because I want to learn those

220
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,600
things too and most importantly we are

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
starting this course with core C++

222
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,160
Notions that are very important so all

223
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,959
of this material is important and um

224
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,680
secret some of it is going to be

225
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,800
pointers that need some stats that's

226
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,519
something that is on interviews at HUD

227
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,120
as well so we we'll start with pointers

228
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,680
already next Thursday it's important

229
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,000
it's core uh core C++ so we'll teach

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,040
that but some later things in C++ some

231
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,120
later editions is something that we

232
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,720
don't have in this course yet so in the

233
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,680
future installments we run this course

234
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,959
and see how it goes maybe the last

235
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,000
lectures would have to be changed

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,600
somewhere else according to the industry

237
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,480
needs

238
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,839
model that's the dis for that and

239
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,560
actually very exciting things um so

240
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,880
everybody is excited these guys from

241
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,240
those companies they want you to join

242
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,160
them and work there essentially there's

243
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,399
so much code that they have in C++ that

244
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,600
needs to be maintained and they just

245
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
don't have qualified people to maintain

246
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
it so you could be

247
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,160
them okay um so okay now U many of you

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,959
know the drill so you see the white

249
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,920
slide that all the slides are white so

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
when you see slider.com slide that's

251
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,079
where you take your phones you put that

252
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,880
number ins slide and you go

253
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
to um

254
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,000
you see that you can ask me

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,399
questions or I can ask you questions

256
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,120
well now I want to learn a little bit

257
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,399
about you let's do what done Exercise

258
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,160
with slide.com so if you there you put

259
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,959
the number let me go back so that you

260
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
know the number I don't know why it

261
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
doesn't show the number here it should

262
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,399
be it should always show the number

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,760
right I hope it works

264
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,199
sometimes like it was not

265
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:38,760
loading yeah it was us up so do you see

266
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
which country you're from is that

267
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,680
something that you can answer is it

268
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,720
answerable no no no no okay let me see

269
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,800
what's going on I'll have to exit the

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,759
slideshow and see what's going

271
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,160
on

272
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
yeah it should be fine

273
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,160
right ah there you go somehow it didn't

274
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
load properly

275
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,120
right okay

276
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,440
so so now what's very exciting about it

277
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,199
is that you guys they

278
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,079
online ah they asked me to be close to

279
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,279
the microphone okay I'll be

280
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,320
I'll try not to walk then

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,800
sorry do you know which microphone we're

282
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,519
using this one okay

283
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,079
oh I don't know I I believe I didn't

284
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,439
connect this one would this be the

285
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
connection is the camera could be the

286
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,759
microphone difficult yep I'll just try

287
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,600
to be here sorry sorry okay is this

288
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,880
better so you guys can now answer too

289
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
the guys who are online can also do the

290
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
same thing and they can

291
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,079
[Music]

292
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,759
um they can answer and we see where you

293
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,440
from Russia Finland Finland Finland

294
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,120
India Finland Sri Lanka Vietnam Libya

295
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,839
Egypt Iraq Iran Algeria all over the

296
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,120
world what is BD

297
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,519
Bangladesh yes okay

298
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,519
cool okay so that's kind of how we do it

299
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,279
so now I want to learn about you not

300
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,440
only where you from but where you from

301
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,920
in terms of you know professionally so

302
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,240
what programming languages are you

303
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,959
already comfortable with BB python C and

304
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:51,199
Java good I imagine that you will have

305
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,800
Java Python

306
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
and and C

307
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,560
mhm and not so much C++ do you see

308
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,319
that and mainly python because I know

309
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,480
that python is taught really well here

310
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,440
at University of Olo and Java too but we

311
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,120
are missing as you can see we are

312
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,360
missing C++ and it turns out there was

313
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,639
no C++ course here at University of Alla

314
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,120
for years now for some reason for some

315
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,639
unknown

316
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,720
reason so it's really good to start it

317
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,880
okay let's do it now how would you rate

318
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,639
your understanding of basic C++ Concepts

319
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,720
and already I see that probably one yeah

320
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,040
okay so two some

321
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,399
twos some fours that's good so those who

322
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,639
are at four level or three level you can

323
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,360
actually contribute a lot to this course

324
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
by going ahead and then helping

325
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,240
everybody debug in this course just like

326
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,880
you know just like the rest of us on the

327
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,120
staff I I hope to see a lot of Comm uh

328
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,959
communication going on on Discord okay

329
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,000
so what do you like in ter in terms of

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,520
software engineering so what do you what

331
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,199
are you passionate about mostly in terms

332
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,400
of

333
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,640
programming embedded systems

334
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,760
cool

335
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,400
web fast programs cool that's C right

336
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,559
then C++ can do that too full St testing

337
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,720
game development okay VR yeah we do VR

338
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,240
and game so so as you can see this is

339
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
something that's already been taught

340
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,400
here at University of Olo robotics cool

341
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,320
best so numerical methods or something

342
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,600
like that or financial say

343
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
um applications that's something that

344
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,559
needs then understanding how to make

345
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,559
your programs fast and that's what C++

346
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,080
is more about rather than Python and

347
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,880
Java that's why we need to do that to

348
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,320
learn it okay so now pick all the

349
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
programming languages Technologies you

350
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
already know so actually I wanted to

351
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
change I forgot which land is it and I

352
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
think I kind of know that okay so you're

353
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,360
coming from Python and c and Java in

354
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,640
that distribution good

355
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,880
good good to

356
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,080
know now what about the rest that's just

357
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,000
for fun like do you like any of those

358
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,120
and how much do you know

359
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,200
including python C and

360
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
Java but what about the other things

361
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
that you might have experienced

362
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,159
with and I know that you know game

363
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,039
development because we teach it you know

364
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
python because we teach it you know

365
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,559
mobile de web development and mobile

366
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,559
Computing because we teach a

367
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,960
train okay look at that c now is number

368
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,760
one and it used to be python hey what's

369
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,120
going on there

370
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,840
now see

371
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,640
maybe

372
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,039
H okay that's interesting so what's good

373
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,320
what's good about c.com is that I can go

374
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,400
back and look at all of the questions

375
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
and all of the answers so if there are

376
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,039
any questions that are left unanswered

377
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,880
in Q&A and you probably see that there's

378
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
a Q&A there on slider.com you can always

379
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,799
put your question there and you'll get

380
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,559
to

381
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,960
it like uh here see this is Q&A and I

382
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,520
think students just added something they

383
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,120
didn't have a chance to uh didn't have

384
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,039
time to answer but this is Q&A slide and

385
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,200
I have them this Q&A slides every two

386
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
slides so that if you have any questions

387
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600

that already on love L that's the main

392
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,200
um way for us to communicate what's the

393
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,120
materials right all the materials of the

394
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,960
course are there all of the homework oh

395
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
yeah all of the homework all of the

396
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,960
materials uh links to lectures all of

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,600
that stuff is there policies it Discord

398
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,720
is for us talk right so that's

399
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,919
um somebody please mute yourself because

400
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,799
I hear

401
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,159
feedback um okay so it Discord you're

402
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,600
there hopefully we don't see as many

403
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,280
people signed up to Discord as on Lovely

404
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,720
so please do that now it's very

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
important please do not send us

406
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,080
individual DMS or emails we will not be

407
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,200
able to process it so I said 230

408
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,240
students here now it's

409
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
270 I don't know today is still a day

410
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
where students register and there's no

411
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,720
way for me to put a cap on it so we

412
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,320
wanted to have 40 students in this

413
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,760
course and two weeks ago there was one

414
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,320
student registered so that's when I made

415
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,080
a mistake of sending an mass

416
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,679
email and then we have almost

417
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,520
300 so let's see how it goes um actually

418
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,880
no DMS no uh direct messages it's it uh

419
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,760
wide Discord policy so I I think I was

420
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,200
answering DMS until I learned from the

421
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,240
administrators that it's actually no

422
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,840
really frowned upon like that's the

423
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,440
policy no DMs if you absolutely have to

424
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
do something it's something personal

425
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
then it's the email because that's the

426
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,840
policy for for Discord but please other

427
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,120
than that if you have a question about

428
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,159
homework just ask everybody because I'm

429
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
sure there will be somebody else or

430
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,320
maybe 10 students or maybe even 50 who

431
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,080
have the same

432
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
question now course resources so let's

433
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,799

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
zoom link but if you don't have a zoom

447
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
link then put on Discord question we'll

448
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,039
put it

449
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,880
there um I think I did maybe now

450
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
computer lab is going to be

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,400
ts35 so the first lab is going to be

452
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,279
today right after the SE 12 there's only

453
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,760
20 stations there how many people do you

454
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,440
have you might actually fit because if

455
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,279
you make a te then you'll be fine Prett

456
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,559
good surprisingly how how did it work

457
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,679
out have 270 students we have only 4ish

458
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,919
here so no problem no stress I was

459
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,080
really stressed about the situation but

460
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,559
seems like maybe it'll sort of resolve

461
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,120
itself

462
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,559
somehow hello world I have not been

463
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,200

that's an email question see that's

468
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,400
personal because that's personal

469
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,880
information everything else about the

470
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
course no personal uh

471
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
emails okay course at a glance let's

472
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,000
look at the course schedule so that's

473
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,960
your main page maybe where I really want

474
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,919
you to be familiar with so we'll go

475
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,919
there okay how do you like

476
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:53,880
it course and deadlines at a glance do

477
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,640
you see this thing is in the way I don't

478
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
know how to minimize it it's going to be

479
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,799
in the way and I want to exit this so

480
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,760
that I have control of my windows and

481
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,279
this thing is in the way okay so let's

482
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,840
look at our course here if you go to C++

483
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
programming this course schedule at a at

484
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
a glance link is your uh very important

485
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,520
link so a goto link that's the schedule

486
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,000
of our lectures schedule of our labs and

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,480
also schedule and deadlines for our

488
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,320
homework work so you will have to get

489
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,200
started with setting up your laptop so

490
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,039
start with that wherever you are in the

491
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,200
lab if you have a laptop if you're

492
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,640
planning to work on machines in the lab

493
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,480
go through that process

494
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,360
there um but I think it's preferable

495
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,559
that you'll be working on your laptops

496
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,880
even my little tablet here can run the

497
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,080
virtual machine so that's what we will

498
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,799
guide you through doing and um you can

499
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,000
complete your exercises even on very

500
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,559
small kind of laptop tablet

501
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,159
whatever um however we still have the

502
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,120
machines there so you're welcome to work

503
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,520
there as well uh look how many Labs we

504
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,600
have seven right and we have four MPS I

505
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,720
would say on average for me completing

506
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,200
this exercises was 1.5 hours or two

507
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
hours yeah some of them I compl in one

508
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
hour when I was repeating and even

509
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,720
second time and the reason is just

510
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,360
because they're long you have to go

511
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,720
through it and read it and understand

512
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
what it is that is asking and there are

513
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,840
puzzles there so that means if you don't

514
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
know how to resolve the puzzle it may it

515
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,799
longer one I think setting up your

516
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,679
laptop to 5 hours one of the tablets for

517
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,399
no reason that I don't remember but it

518
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,480
took me five hours something didn't work

519
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,360
I don't all of that is which means that

520
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,399
don't leave it until the last

521
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,240
and think of this course as a boot point

522
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,279
this is serious stuff this is how univ

523
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,919
of Illinois like you will spend time

524
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,120
learning this language you cannot learn

525
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
a language you cannot use language you

526
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
canot communicate in language if you

527
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,520
don't practice it every day so that's

528
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,679
kind of a goal you'll be practicing

529
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,600
every day if you leave it until the last

530
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,039
hours before the deadline you may not be

531
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,559
able to complete it sorry I left my

532
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,480
station here so you will not be able to

533
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,399
complete it right just because you know

534
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,080
your your system will decide to update

535
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
and it takes hours

536
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
right um so so those things like just

537
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,360
start now just do it okay and I've

538
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,679
noticed that some of you have there's

539
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
one student who completed everything

540
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
already and we want to talk to you

541
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,520
whoever that is like really really you

542
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,520
can help us help

543
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,240
us okay so that's really cool so which

544
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,279
means that you know you can like you can

545
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,039
if you just do it it's not unheard of to

546
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,919
spend 20 hours a week on the

547
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,960
course how it is and you know what since

548
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,919
it's a pilot we'll run it the way it was

549
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,880
at the University of Illinois why not

550
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,600
that's that course was a legend we want

551
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,559
to repeat the same experience because it

552
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,520
was also known that if you go through

553
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,880
this you get a job if if you go through

554
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,000
it successfully you get a job so full

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
stop okay um some MPS take longer on

556
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,559
average because that's individual

557
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,919
assignment and it it is kind of

558
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,760
scheduled to take two weeks versus one

559
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,799
week um you should do this individually

560
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,000
you should do this in a group

561
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,919
of you know what is it three people can

562
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:47,760
I

563
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,519
look I forgot what I said oh no groups

564
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,480
yet okay I think it's three

565
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,200
people I wasn't sure I was

566
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,919
yeah I think it's three whatever it says

567
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,200
here actually Let's see we have forming

568
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,519
groups didn't say it there okay let's

569
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,720
let's figure it out because you'll be

570
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,000
forming groups right now and I know that

571
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
it's this information is right

572
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,279
here three people so okay very helpful

573
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
because then you can interact and solve

574
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,440
those problems so three people per

575
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,279
group

576
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,399
okay let's go back to our slides let's

577
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,840
see what else I wanted to say here so

578
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,799
course schedule is is is

579
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,919
tough now how do you complete your

580
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,000
homework your own laptop as I said is

581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,440
preferable there's PCS in ts1 35 which

582
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,440
is fine but they just not many of them

583
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,640
and however if you have to use them the

584
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,000
good news is that after 400 p.m. and on

585
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,840
weekends they yours for you so you just

586
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,919
do it um but the first option is

587
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,919
preferable because um because of the

588
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
size of the class okay let's go through

589
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
the questions I have not been accepted

590
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,360
to the course in Pepe many other people

591
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,840
have this problem also I noticed that

592
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,960
because we have 270 on Lovel

593
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,240
and 230 on pepy so I think there's 30

594
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,039
people that are missing somewhere I

595
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,840
wanted I even have a slide about it like

596
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,080
where are you people why are you not on

597
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,840
pey okay that means I'll get 30 idual

598
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,919
emails and that's fine because I'll get

599
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,760
you in then that's important hello

600
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,159
world we do we need to register both in

601
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,880
love less and tudo I don't know what

602
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,679
tudo is instructors don't have tudo I

603
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,200
have no idea maybe who are more close to

604
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,120
you guys in terms of like they I think

605
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,559
by T they mean py then yeah once you're

606
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,279
in py you'll get your tudo schedule

607
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,480
right it's for

608
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,760
schedules what is recommended group size

609
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,799
three you can do it alone by the way

610
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
you're welcome to do all of the labs

611
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,279
alone or two people that's fine but you

612
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,519
can have up to three and the system will

613
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,080
not let you have more so that's um is it

614
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,799
possible no it's not possible because

615
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,960
it's set up to three we don't want four

616
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,080
people four people groups are known to

617
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,840
be

618
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,360
less less use less they don't work out

619
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,799
as well as three or two two are not as

620
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,679
well three is a really good size for

621
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,120
groups in terms of who does what work

622
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,600
okay is it possible to do lab

623
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,200
assignments alone yes yes yes yes okay

624
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,640
so that's how the Q&A works so very

625
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,320
useful do you guys have any questions so

626
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
far just raise your hand do you get

627
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,519
feedback even if you get full marks and

628
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,679
levels maybe the solution is not

629
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,279
perfect

630
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,799
um that's where I think I really expect

631
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,240
you to go to ask these questions on this

632
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,440
Discord and we'll discuss your solution

633
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,039
whether it's perfect or not whether it's

634
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,880
elegant or not whether it's good writing

635
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,360
style or not coding style or not so

636
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,600
that's that's a perfect question and

637
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,639
please ask these kind of questions on um

638
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,000
on

639
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,360
Discord I cannot guarantee that we'll

640
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,960
answer all of them depending on the size

641
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,840
but we'll try that that's what we really

642
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,279
want to do guide you through this yeah

643
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,559
so how do we ask this kind of question I

644
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,880
mean we are not uh we shouldn't reveal

645
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
our code yeah be careful of

646
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,480
course

647
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,120
um first of all after the deadline you

648
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,159
could so this is a if it's a coding

649
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,559
style question then after afterwards

650
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,080
it's fine um although some students may

651
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,840
be still submitting later so I'll talk

652
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,519
about late submission policy we do have

653
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,720
late submission policy but I think it's

654
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,039
fair game to to do that you be able to

655
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,000
like link answer to the submission on so

656
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,120
us can that's true that's another that's

657
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,600
an elegant

658
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
solution you can say hey can you look up

659
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,240
at my yeah that's a that's a better

660
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,519
solution I'm not sure cute guys will

661
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:17,519
have access to that yeah I guess we're

662
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,919
gonna talk

663
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,000
with yeah we can add them Grant

664
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,039
MTA

665
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,880
l so yeah yeah little for m

666
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
is there many no there's no restriction

667
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,519
how many times you can try to submit on

668
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,639
love La so love La is essentially a web

669
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:36,960
compiler so you submit your solution you

670
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,919
submit your files it'll compile it spit

671
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,799
out whatever it is if it doesn't compile

672
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,320
it will tell you

673
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,080
why and if it doesn't run if there's

674
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,600
memory it will tell you that as well so

675
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,120
you'll have feedback and you can

676
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,559
continue submitting

677
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,240
it um as long as many as many times as

678
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,200
you want do we get feedback even if we

679
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,840
get oh yeah yes I answered that okay

680
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,880
cool grading so let's look at the

681
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,000
distribution for individual assignments

682
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,760
there are four of them 40 points Labs 37

683
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,120
points because one of them is a little

684
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,000
longer seven points every other lab is

685
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,840
Five

686
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,480
Points exam will be 30 points so it'll

687
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,039
take a big chunk of your grade because

688
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,600
well it's important then will be

689
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,360
something unpredictable unknown

690
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,720
something that's harder to find on web

691
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,000
uh MPS and Labs you may find some

692
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,480
similar solution somewhere and I'll have

693
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,480
the the slide about academic

694
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,799
Integrity um but you know just or you

695
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,559
may ask your friend you know we we just

696
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,480
really want to make sure that exam will

697
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,440
correct for that that will be just you

698
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,360
having an enormous amount of work to do

699
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,120
in two

700
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,279
hours that is really hard to find

701
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,159
Solutions any anywhere or ask CH GPT you

702
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,480
know those kind of things so exam will

703
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,840
correct for any kind of problems like

704
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,360
that we'll really want to make sure you

705
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,639
you know what you're talking about there

706
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
so total points you can see that they

707
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,599
add up more to to more than 100 which

708
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,560
means that there's extra credit right so

709
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,879
if you miss one assignment you may still

710
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:21,000
compensate later and you pass if it's

711
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,040
more than 65 points so you need to do

712
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,199
all of the homework if you want to pass

713
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,719
right uh at least

714
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,719
and that's that's a good thing and this

715
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,719
is the grade distribution so you get a

716
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,079
five if you are really fluent in C++

717
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,719
which is more than

718
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,879
95 but remember there's extra credit

719
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,280
right okay there's chat

720
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,119
question oh yeah please ask on on um

721
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,839
these kind of questions now on

722
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,560
slider.com

723
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,199
okay so now late submission policy so if

724
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,520
you submit after the deadline you get

725
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,760
80% % for assignment no

726
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,359
exceptions oh if you have an official

727
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,839
document yeah yes sure but but it's a

728
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,200
small

729
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,400
enough it's a small enough

730
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,040
um what's the right

731
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,880
word penalty penalty yeah that's small

732
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,200
enough penalty so no problem right um

733
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,599
take your time with it but we just don't

734
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,079
we don't encourage it

735
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,839
because if

736
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
you if you start being late with your

737
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
submissions then what you'll be late

738
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,200
right okay and so so this means that

739
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,839
roughly you lose one or two points per

740
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:40,480
late submission and there are many

741
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
submissions are seven labs and four and

742
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,680
P so you can lose a lot of points if you

743
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,280
do it late so what's the point

744
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,440
right don't do it late it's very

745
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,480
important to keep deadlines so some St

746
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,800
people are much more productive if

747
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
there's a deadline so that's why we have

748
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,640
very straight deadlines but the penalty

749
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,839
is not so

750
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,240
bad now a little bit about the history

751
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,079
of the course so it's modeled after the

752
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,480
C++ course at U as I said and I taught

753
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,720
it personally for two years there were

754
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,599
700 more than 700 students there so we

755
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,800
are prepared this course is the

756
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,920
infrastructure is ready to take a lot of

757
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,359
students it's just that we didn't want

758
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,079
to do it in the pilot run here so we

759
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,839
don't have physical space so the

760
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,079
physical space is the bottleneck but hey

761
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,720
maybe it's not

762
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,960
so we'll see and um yeah as I said be

763
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,079
prepared to work really hard and um

764
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,640
maybe spend 20 hours of work of work a

765
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,800
week but in the end of the day

766
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,359
hopefully you know you you Le a job if

767
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,480
you do really well and that's our goal

768
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
our goal is to connect you with the

769
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,839
local industry needs so what the scores

770
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,880
is

771
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,880
like for some of you it may feel like

772
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,640
you're a surfer and there's big wave and

773
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,760
there may be weeks where the wave is

774
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,359
just you feel like that's it and that's

775
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,200
when you go on Discord and ask us

776
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,400
questions okay there may be sharks there

777
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,839
not just friendly Dolphins maybe really

778
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,480
really bad stuff you know maybe it will

779
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
feel

780
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,560
overwhelming and you have to work hard

781
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,119
and keep going right so that's that's

782
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,599
the goal that's kind of the idea that's

783
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,000
the metaphor here that's the what the

784
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,119
course is

785
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,400
like guys can you please mute

786
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,400
again because I I hear myself if you're

787
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,880
stuck Discord just Discord please ask we

788
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
really want to

789
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,160
help and uh don't wait until the last

790
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,280
minute I think I went through this again

791
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,119
because there may be so many problems

792
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,160
that unpredictable things that will take

793
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,720
time and you lose your points academic

794
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Integrity don't

795
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,200
plagiarize don't just don't uh it's

796
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,160
disservice right it's disservice like if

797
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,760
I ask Google translate I don't learn the

798
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,880
language so if you ask chat GPT maybe I

799
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
try to run all of the assignments chat

800
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
GPT uh I think you really need to know

801
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,920
C++ in order to use the answers so so I

802
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,839
think it may slow you down significantly

803
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,119
on some assignments and introduce bugs

804
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,079
that you'll be like you know it's longer

805
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,040
to solve them then just write it

806
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,440
yourself so so just don't do it it's a

807
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,760
disservice to yourself right it is it

808
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,720
just robbing you off uh from this

809
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,920
experience of understanding things there

810
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,680
are really nice puzzles there that if

811
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,800
you do it you'll have a good feeling

812
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,079
about yourself so just do it that way

813
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,839
however we will run the plagerism check

814
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,240
in the end so if you find

815
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,359
you similar code with your friends on

816
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,839
individual assignments you know we'll

817
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,880
will follow whatever the GU guidelines

818
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,960
for that so just don't do it it's not

819
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,800
worth it

820
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,599
and also the exams are tough so if you

821
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,680
don't do the work yourself um then it

822
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,480
will be really really hard to do it

823
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
quickly on the

824
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,680
exam oh I forgot to mention that you can

825
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,160
complete any work from anywhere not only

826
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
from home from airplane anywhere I've

827
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,040
had students who are flying back home

828
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
and were submitting uh exams on from

829
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,240
airplane as long as you have a good

830
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,920
connection and you have your laptop it

831
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,680
just works you can do it from anywhere

832
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,920
so we really excited actually about uh

833
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,800
lovely and US putting our courses there

834
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,680
because you can be anywhere that's cool

835
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,599
so this is the numbers again uh oh okay

836
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,440
so there's

837
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,880
274 students and Lovel and only 240

838
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,960
students and Peppe I already hear you

839
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,599
that you guys could not get on Pepe I'll

840
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,680
help you with that but there's some

841
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,960
students who are registered in love not

842
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,760
with University email so here's the

843
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,000
trick if you didn't use your University

844
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,359
email please raise your hand if you

845
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,440
didn't use your University email anybody

846
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,960
here so if it's not all P the fee on uh

847
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,720
love L you do not get a credit for the

848
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,880
course because I we just for for all we

849
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,599
know we don't know who you are we don't

850
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,280
know how to locate you in our system

851
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,280
some students are here from om and

852
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,319
you're welcome you just cannot get a

853
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:25,640
grade if you're not registered through

854
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,720
University email and if you're not on

855
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,520
Pepe so there are some students who want

856
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,960
to take this course just because just

857
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,480
because it is a needed course right and

858
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,200
you're welcome I'm just saying that if

859
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,319
you want a grade you have to be enrolled

860
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,160
on Pepe with University email and I've

861
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,560
seen I think at least 10 people not with

862
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
University email you don't get a grade

863
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,880
if you don't do if you don't change

864
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,560
it

865
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,880
okay can I ask yes

866
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,040
so so if I have enrolled with the

867
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,920
University email but I have not been

868
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,880
able to find this course so on yeah so

869
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,040
I'm just wondering like how it happens

870
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,000
you send me an email and I'll enoll you

871
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,280
on but there four cases when I did that

872
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,319
for students in the past and still their

873
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:19,440
program managers complain that they

874
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,839
didn't go through them like maybe

875
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,599
depending where you are maybe you have

876
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,599
to make sure that they'll let you sign

877
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,599
up on

878
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,760
pep and that's only for getting credit

879
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,520
again you're welcome to just go through

880
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,480
assignments and do it yourself but if

881
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,160
you need credit for it then you I may

882
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,520
help you get an Pepe but it may not be

883
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,520
enough your program might

884
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,480
complain okay does that make

885
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,440
sense uh yes I will check so it's just

886
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,160
good to know that this class should be

887
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,560
in pep so it should be

888
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,960
yeah okay okay but send me an email

889
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
then okay so those are the only

890
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,560
individual emails about uh getting

891
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,359
on are the exercise sessions so that we

892
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,520
can only ask help for exercises or is

893
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,319
there like extra info that we need in

894
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,920
order to complete the exercises I think

895
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,760
we'll see how it goes what what do you

896
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,440
think guys will there be extra

897
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,160
information or will it be just ask

898
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
questions

899
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,760
probably just questions just questions

900
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,400
yeah unless it seems like there like a

901
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,720
big problem that everyone is if

902
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,440
everybody has the same problem then we

903
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,559
will then Tas during the El Maran during

904
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,760
the lab sessions they'll explain things

905
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,400
but then we'll make sure that we repeat

906
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,280
the same explanation say on Discord

907
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,720
right so if there was if there will be

908
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,599
the same question over and over then

909
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
we'll just posted on Discord that

910
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,200
discussion okay what is the email to

911
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,400
send to the Pepe query uh on

912
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,119
laal so like everybody has first name

913
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,280
last name first name. last name

914
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,880
at what is the course go I don't know

915
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,680
sorry

916
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
okay um but again please send me the

917
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,960
email about that and we'll I'll find

918
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,280
that number I just don't know it off the

919
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,400
top of my head and pep is way too slow

920
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,520
for me to load it now if you have the

921
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,000
answer to that question please post it

922
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,920
by the way if you if you can find the

923
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,559
number on Pepe for other students okay

924
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,880
or post it on Discord that

925
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,680
you now to-do list for today so go to

926
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,880
the lab and now the exercises so you

927
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,800
should start on this three exercises

928
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,760
today laptop set up instructions right

929
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,040
away lab GDB and make file tutorial

930
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,400
because the deadlines for these two

931
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,559
assignments is in one week so you

932
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,280
probably feel like okay let's get to

933
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,040
work let's get to work I think I'm done

934
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,960
with all of the infrastructure questions

935
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,400
we'll get to work okay everybody on

936
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,520
board we'll get to work inro that's in

937
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,800
one

938
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,599
week oh did I say l GB ha yeah it's

939
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,640
l yeah sorry well it's on yeah okay good

940
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,480
correction okay I see more

941
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,000
questions are

942
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,359
questions will this year's lectures yes

943
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:39,839
I'm recording the lectur so all lectures

944
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,920
I'll be recorded this is the number on

945
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,040
py so I hope it's useful you can see it

946
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,800
take a screenshot because I'm going to

947
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,280
switch to our work so let's start

948
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,359
on keep annotations okay let's start on

949
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:57,520
our

950
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,240
next

951
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,319
lecture and I'm going to start slideshow

952
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,160
with presenter view

953
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,559
because otherwise it'll kick me out from

954
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,359
this mode okay cool let's put this here

955
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:16,040
let's put this here out of the way we're

956
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,359
going to start talking about Hello World

957
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,040
classes and a little bit about

958
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,599
encapsulation if you notice why slider

959
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,000
it's it's doing it again right is it

960
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,079
doing it

961
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,480
again there is no

962
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,720
number how did I just try again right

963
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,480
try again yep maybe I should start with

964
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,000
slide though yeah exit slideshow maybe I

965
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,960
should re before it wasn't like this ah

966
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,200
yeah okay sorry slider is changing it's

967
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,119
a very useful thing to have because I

968
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,640
can have feedback like this

969
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,520
but they constantly update and I have to

970
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,800
get used to like the new

971
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,520
things and it's

972
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,240
slow okay so we are switching to another

973
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,520
presentation and it's another slide.

974
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,720
come because of that here so if you have

975
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,280
any questions put it there now we'll

976
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,160
have to do this so let's follow your

977
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,920
print out and you know some people

978
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,119
really learn well if they write so

979
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,000
you're welcome to do that please raise

980
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,520
your hand if

981
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,280
you um please your hand if you learn by

982
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
writing

983
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,480
[Music]

984
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,040
always upload slides on Google Drive and

985
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,880
work on your computer write over those

986
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,960
slides online and many of you I see have

987
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,119
tablets do that but if you appreciate

988
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,200
this just give me feedback if you

989
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,839
appreciate this slide print outs then

990
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,960
we'll keep going with

991
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
those

992
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,240
okay or Nina raised hand

993
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
you

994
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,279
uh I don't know what it means

995
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,200
okay so this is our first

996
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,559
slide we can do anything without

997
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:49,520
variables so many of you probably know

998
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,800
about variables in C++ already but let's

999
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,520
just go through it let's see what we

1000
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,240
have

1001
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,319
to do what what what is the deal with

1002
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:03,280
variables in C++ so every variable will

1003
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,520
have a

1004
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,920
name a

1005
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,200
type

1006
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,599
value and location in memory okay so

1007
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,160
here's one variable I'm going to declare

1008
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
and this is going to be my declaration

1009
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,920
so I'm going to declare a variable in

1010
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,960
C++ so it's going to be

1011
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,880
declaration I'm going to say

1012
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,559
buan is here and let's see if it has all

1013
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,559
four so what's the name is here type

1014
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,960
bullan what's the

1015
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,760
location it's implicit

1016
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,839
yeah some address right some address but

1017
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,200
you don't know it it's implicit the

1018
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,040
system will give it will provide that

1019
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,480
location for that variable and what's

1020
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,680
the

1021
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,839
value the system will most likely just

1022
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,920
recycle whatever was at that location

1023
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,440
because you didn't provide any value you

1024
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,040
just declared a variable so we call it

1025
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,599
garbage so let's draw garbage bin here

1026
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,760
we call it a garbage because it's

1027
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,240
recycled stuff cool now this there's a

1028
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,040
so we covered this there's another

1029
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,680
variable

1030
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,920
declaration so these are going to be

1031
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,400
declarations my favorite int has name my

1032
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,079
favorite int type

1033
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,000
integer location implicitly provided by

1034
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,960
the system value garbage okay so I could

1035
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,319
actually

1036
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:50,640
Define can you mute please because I

1037
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,359
hear myself again I could actually have

1038
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,319
definition definitions

1039
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:00,720
here and I could actually Define or

1040
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,480
prescribe the value that I want to be

1041
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,480
stored in that location for is sphere

1042
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,920
and I say true and I put

1043
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,480
semicolon because in C++ it will not

1044
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,599
understand that it's the end of the

1045
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,839
statement unless you put semicolon so

1046
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,920
that's a delimeter of

1047
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,359
statements and um and then I put that

1048
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,880
value true

1049
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,880
in that location okay and in C++ there

1050
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,520
will be a way to

1051
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,119
control which location for the variable

1052
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,799
will be assigned by the system or

1053
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,119
sometimes you can just allow the system

1054
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,319
to pick yourself for itself so you can

1055
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,440
combine declaration and definition in

1056
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,440
one line like this so for this um type

1057
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,200
character CH rating name rating you can

1058
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,000
give value e

1059
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,400
to be in that implicit location and

1060
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,799
W uh half

1061
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:05,760
37.0 value okay so these are both

1062
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,920
declarations and definitions so what's

1063
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,880
interesting about it is that these are

1064
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,160
primitive types right and you can Google

1065
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,440
C++ has lots of primitive types but

1066
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,720
they're not very interesting right

1067
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,000
they're primitive so what's really good

1068
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,640
about C++ is that it allows you to

1069
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,000
Define your own types and the user

1070
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,839
defined types are called classes you

1071
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:32,200
probably heard the word class from java

1072
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,720
but this is slightly different here

1073
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,240
because in C++ classes or user defined

1074
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,400
types are meant to be treated exactly as

1075
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,160
if they were primitive types so the

1076
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,599
syntax is going to be the same so here

1077
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,240
is a

1078
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,680
declaration of a variable with the name

1079
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,640
my favorite sphere type sphere and that

1080
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,000
is a user defined type a class class

1081
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,400
sphere which you know will spend some

1082
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,240
lectures defining in many different ways

1083
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,440
including today how we would Define this

1084
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,119
class sphere but so far we declare a

1085
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,280
variable of that type right and what its

1086
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,640
location again just like with primitive

1087
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,520
types it's whatever system will choose

1088
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,720
and the value is garbage so far because

1089
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,559
we didn't Define it right so to

1090
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,000
summarize let's write down what a class

1091
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,280
is so

1092
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,240
definition a

1093
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,200
class is a group

1094
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,799
of so here's what what is that do you

1095
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,359
know primitive types

1096
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,440
yeah or a group of we call it variables

1097
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
variables yeah

1098
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,119
variables very good a group of variables

1099
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,480
so you can think of dat data associated

1100
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,480
with

1101
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,559
that user type and

1102
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:07,280
functionalities the functions

1103
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,040
functions because let's think about what

1104
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,720
this instance of a sphere should be it

1105
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,200
should be something we want to do with

1106
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,799
spheres right and something that it

1107
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:21,359
stores so um the the way we'll decide

1108
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,680
design the class will be defining this

1109
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,920
group of variables and functions of what

1110
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,920
can be done and what these spheres are

1111
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,680
and let's look at the next slide to

1112
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,880
start doing exactly

1113
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,799
that the C++ variables doesn't have any

1114
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:41,000
default values yeah yeah some sometimes

1115
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,559
it'll have the it depends on the

1116
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,240
compiler so you should never let the

1117
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,319
rely on default

1118
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:50,400
values that's good practice to have full

1119
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,640
control of what is initialized if you

1120
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,000
leave it up to the system it could be

1121
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,799
some default vales or it could be really

1122
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,280
truly

1123
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,599
garbage depending on the

1124
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,280
compiler uh what if we compare variables

1125
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,760
to Define value yeah yeah I think I

1126
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,640
answered the question

1127
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,000
right okay so now let's start designing

1128
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,880
the class and on your printouts I

1129
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,960
realize that the cop here didn't see

1130
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,720
those colors but you can draw on top

1131
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,119
that we have this oh that one shows it

1132
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,720
okay sometimes projectors don't show

1133
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,200
Colors either so let's look at this

1134
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,359
possible spheres and see what kind of

1135
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,839
variables do we want to have associated

1136
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,160
with this class and what kind of

1137
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,280
functionalities so what would you want

1138
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,559
the Spheres be or how would you want

1139
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:44,400
them to be different right so what could

1140
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,799
be the data associated with the sphere

1141
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:50,520
or representing the sphere what would be

1142
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,000
the variables

1143
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,359
representing radius yeah very good so

1144
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,920
let's see so data or variables

1145
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,920
variables could be radius very

1146
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,160
good but then this purple sphere or

1147
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,599
magenta sphere and this green sphere

1148
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,160
they are like twins right they're not

1149
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,559
different if that's your design so this

1150
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,119
is a design Choice as a software

1151
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,480
engineer you'll always have these

1152
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,839
choices what do I want to uh the sphere

1153
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,240
class or user defined class to represent

1154
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,319
and um you want maybe you want the

1155
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:28,200
Spheres to be twins but maybe not and

1156
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,039
then you would pick another variable say

1157
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,280
color

1158
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,400
right and then based on color these

1159
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,599
little guys here they're all tuplets

1160
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
right eight identical spheres because

1161
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,760
they have the same radius and the same

1162
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,920
color and if you want them to be

1163
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,400
different you would maybe introduce

1164
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,880
something else

1165
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,440
right like U what

1166
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,039
Center coordinate

1167
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:00,079
the center right so

1168
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,680
location then then it would make all of

1169
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,039
and if that's what you want that's what

1170
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:07,400
you do now functionalities what would

1171
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,480
you want the Spheres to

1172
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,000
do I don't know we don't know yet right

1173
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,799
we don't have any code in mind but I

1174
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,200
want to write my first class and I have

1175
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,920
my

1176
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,480
uh

1177
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,599
um yes I have my Ubuntu here so I can

1178
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:31,680
actually go to lectures and I want to

1179
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,160
start writing let me remove my program

1180
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,839
CPP and remove okay maybe out okay so I

1181
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,400
want to start writing my first program

1182
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,240
so I'm going to say program

1183
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,480
CPP and we are going to write this

1184
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,880
class and I think you have it

1185
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,359
on but I'm going to start with the

1186
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:05,000
keyword class so this keyword says that

1187
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,520
it's going to be the definition of the

1188
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,359
user type with the name whatever follows

1189
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,640
after the keyword class

1190
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,720
sphere and then I put curly brackets

1191
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,000
here and put semicolon right there for

1192
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,119
the compiler to know that that's the end

1193
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:26,079
of my user find user type

1194
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,119
definition hey that's it I wrote my

1195
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,640
first program I wrote my first

1196
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,680
class now I can show you how to compile

1197
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,599
this little program so we call the G the

1198
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:41,319
C++ compiler we will use

1199
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,880
g++ there may be better compilers out

1200
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,640
there but that's what we use for now

1201
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,359
maybe in the future itations will change

1202
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,240
depending on how it goes but all you do

1203
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,520
is you compile this program CPP

1204
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,559
and what the compiler will do it will

1205
00:57:57,559 --> 00:57:59,920
first check the syntax if everything is

1206
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,760
correct and second it will create an

1207
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,039
executable to run the code so first

1208
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,680
check the syntax then create this

1209
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,079
machine code into the

1210
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,720
executable and then so that you can run

1211
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,079
it and in fact make pile tutorial walks

1212
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,119
you through the process very well it's a

1213
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,839
very well written tutorial about how to

1214
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,359
compile many files together and how then

1215
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:28,200
these uh build-in blocks for machine

1216
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,520
code are linked together but this is

1217
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,400
just one file so there's no linking much

1218
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,000
so let's see what they what it does H it

1219
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,039
bared so

1220
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,079
so and this means that something went

1221
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:50,119
wrong either with syntax or with the

1222
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:53,720
building so in this

1223
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,319
case and kind of guess what's going

1224
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,520
wrong so I don't know if you can

1225
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,160
look hey guys please mute yourself um

1226
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,119
the sentence says something complaining

1227
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:12,240
about main so do you know what went

1228
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,359
wrong I have a question here maybe some

1229
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:18,799
of you already know why doesn't it

1230
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,640
compile huh

1231
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,920
you can

1232
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,599
answer you can answer on

1233
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,839
slider need the main function that's

1234
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,880
true okay so it will never if you don't

1235
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,160
have a main function so main function is

1236
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,880
this magical control station that's

1237
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,839
where everything starts it's really nice

1238
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:50,359
to know that you know you can always

1239
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,160
untangle

1240
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,000
starting with the main function I wish I

1241
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,680
could mute you know my

1242
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,839
whole you should be able to but it's

1243
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:07,200
mute do you see that like it's somewhere

1244
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,520
in Zoom where I should mute participants

1245
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,359
and if I mute myself yeah oh

1246
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,400
participants yeah like open the

1247
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,319
participants and

1248
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:26,559
then

1249
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,119
no no please guys

1250
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,960
ask please ask on

1251
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,079
slidec sorry they're like it's so mean

1252
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,680
to make fun of them you know they online

1253
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,480
really sorry that's how it goes you guys

1254
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,359
you don't have physical self to to stand

1255
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,680
by yourself okay so need the main right

1256
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,480
so the main function is the control and

1257
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,000
you can untangle the whole logic of your

1258
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,960
program just looking at what main does

1259
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,920
and then going inside see what they do

1260
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,240
so there's no main program program it

1261
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,680
will not uh compile it it actually in

1262
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,119
terms of syntax it's it's okay it just

1263
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,799
doesn't want to build an executable

1264
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,319
because there's no main function there's

1265
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,079
nothing to build so let's fix it I'm

1266
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:17,000
going to do the bare minimum and that

1267
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,319
will be your next slide already so I'm

1268
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,640
going to say okay you need a main

1269
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,000
function let's write a main function so

1270
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to say int main it's a

1271
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,760
function so

1272
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,240
um so it will have it may have some

1273
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,520
parameters but in this case it's a bare

1274
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,640
minimum and I don't put a semicolon here

1275
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,720
don't ask me why I forget I always

1276
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,520
prepare and I forget and this time I

1277
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,680
even forgot to prepare like I don't know

1278
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,039
why there's no semicolon here but it's

1279
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,720
important for the syntax to have

1280
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,720
semicolon your classes anyway if it

1281
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
doesn't compile try a semicolon

1282
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,599
sometimes and it will one of this deals

1283
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,880
but I'm sure there is a more

1284
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,039
sophisticated explanation that we

1285
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:03,160
should uh we should send it to

1286
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,720
V okay

1287
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,920
so is it good now any questions any

1288
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,960
surprises

1289
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,079
here yeah question related to my

1290
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,480
previous question that I asked that so

1291
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,119
you said that the compiler defines the

1292
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,920
uh default values for the very

1293
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,599
right so if we use some kind of

1294
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,880
comparison operation that will not

1295
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,920
return an error right it will just maybe

1296
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,359
return some garbage because yeah and

1297
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,400
different garbage

1298
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,000
depending no error always need oh no no

1299
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,359
no right right it will be runtime error

1300
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,039
versus compile error yeah if if if

1301
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,400
you're relying oh the if you're relying

1302
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,920
on some default behavior of the system

1303
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,760
sometimes it can be Insidious bugs

1304
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,160
errors those are really really hard to

1305
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,000
find and that's why the good practice is

1306
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,720
to never rely on

1307
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,680
this

1308
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,520
stuff one question about that so I

1309
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,640
remember there was something related to

1310
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,440
this like when you define main they

1311
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,480
always use this

1312
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,039
void void that's C right so here in C++

1313
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:20,359
it has to be integer so that's the

1314
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,720
convention it has to be integer so you

1315
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,079
have to return some integer and this is

1316
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,440
also controlled for you so you can say I

1317
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,240
I return zero and then I'll know that if

1318
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,319
the return value is zero then the

1319
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,880
function executed to that line so you

1320
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,480
can put something like control blocks

1321
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,039
and depending on what's returned you'll

1322
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,480
know where it's sto and didn't work but

1323
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,359
that's the convention so you might want

1324
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,799
to put void here you might and then some

1325
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,000
compilers will complain I mean the

1326
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,319
compiler will have to figure out what

1327
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,960
did you mean and some of them will

1328
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,760
figure it out and some of them will not

1329
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,520
I know C++ it will not it will just not

1330
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,359
compile it'll say Hey you have to return

1331
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,599
an integer value for me but you can uh

1332
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:04,400
try it on different compil and see how

1333
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,760
it works okay are we are we what's the

1334
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,319
time

1335
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,200
11 oh so we still have half an hour yes

1336
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,440
okay good okay so so far so good

1337
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,319
right so the logic it's very important

1338
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:23,480
for me to follow what what is the story

1339
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,920
so we're building this little program

1340
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,400
from bare minimum our main function is

1341
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,559
now very boring and the class is boring

1342
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:33,960
does nothing but I hope it'll compile

1343
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,359
now what do you think

1344
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:41,880
yay all clean no complaining and what is

1345
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,960
going to happen do you see what happened

1346
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,880
in my directory I'm listing all of the

1347
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,839
files so this is my program CPP and new

1348
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:51,279
green file an executable has been

1349
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:54,000
created and by default an executable is

1350
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,720
called called a out sometimes it's a as

1351
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,599
utable but and you can change that so

1352
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,559
main file tutorial will will help you

1353
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,839
with that so you can I can say that okay

1354
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:08,079
I want it to be called program as aable

1355
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,119
you know like that and then I list the

1356
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,119
program the files and I have programable

1357
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,000
so you can direct the compiler to do

1358
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,240
many things to name files and in fact

1359
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,880
you can write a make file script that

1360
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,680
will direct the compiler to do things in

1361
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,480
different steps and that's what m file

1362
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,200
tutorial is about how to write those m

1363
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,039
files that will follow the steps of

1364
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,920
compilation of different files into the

1365
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,000
Final Exit or into several exit if you

1366
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,599
want so that's cool but by default so

1367
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:42,839
let's go back to our slide and fill out

1368
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,559
this

1369
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,960
things um I'll come back so let's let's

1370
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,760
not forget to come back back to this

1371
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,119
questions but let me just finish this

1372
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:55,760
for for this little simple program

1373
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,440
CPP I compile it with this

1374
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,559
command I compile a chat synx I created

1375
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,480
as a uable a out by default sometimes a

1376
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,680
as eable and to run you have to put dot

1377
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,760
slash so to running aable from the Comm

1378
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,960
from the terminal you put a uh dot slash

1379
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,119
a out the name of your utable and then

1380
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,000
the output was did we run it we didn't

1381
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,960
run it yet so do slash out what do you

1382
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,440
think will be the

1383
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,440
output nothing nothing it does nothing

1384
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,160
it's a very Bor boring program Okay cool

1385
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,279
so let's go back to the

1386
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,599
questions yeah we I answered this

1387
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:45,160
one we can use signed main instead uh

1388
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,960
yeah uh what's the difference we can use

1389
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,200
signed main instead of original yeah I

1390
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,520
think so signed

1391
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,440
integer versus I've never uh tried it so

1392
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,440
that's this is an example of a question

1393
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,559
that if you really want to know I think

1394
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,440
most of our uh Labs will have integer

1395
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,039
maybe you can use sign maybe not I could

1396
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,680
try to run it like if you had your

1397
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,200
laptop you could take that program and

1398
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,319
see if it compiles I don't know that's

1399
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,079
the question that is a little bit

1400
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,799
nuanced and I don't I don't know sorry

1401
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,599
but this is the example of a question

1402
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,200
that we should keep and maybe like keep

1403
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,200
a list for like if if uh our cute guys

1404
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,640
would want to answer those or

1405
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,440
not please repeat that question I just

1406
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,920
deleted the one that was there sorry

1407
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,480
sorry didn't mean to I remember it was

1408
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,279
like what's the best way to learn C++

1409
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:45,680
this feels difficult this seems

1410
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,279
difficult

1411
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:51,279
no

1412
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:55,319
no I don't know

1413
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,279
I'm sorry this a yes it's a language you

1414
01:07:58,279 --> 01:08:01,039
know Finnish language is difficult d++

1415
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,160
is not like I have to tell

1416
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,960
you if you speak Finnish then you can do

1417
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,640
it if you don't speak finish I you still

1418
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,920
can do it because finish is hard C++ it

1419
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,440
just practice okay you'll write this

1420
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,198
program many times you'll be able to

1421
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,759
write a simple hello world problem but

1422
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,198
then what is really cool about our

1423
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,679
assignments is that we'll never ask you

1424
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:24,319
to write anything from scratch instead

1425
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,120
we'll give you a bunch of code and

1426
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,520
you'll look at it and it's a

1427
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,839
well-written code and you'll have to

1428
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,359
just figure some bugs that we planted

1429
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,040
okay so the first uh lab it's like only

1430
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,158
maybe a couple of lines that you really

1431
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:38,399
will have to

1432
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,920
write and those lines can we figure out

1433
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,520
from this uh contest here you know and

1434
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,839
ask us so like don't be worried it's

1435
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:49,439
it's a language it's a language so it's

1436
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,839
new and I get it it's hard but we're

1437
01:08:52,839 --> 01:08:54,640
going to write more so now we're going

1438
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,158
to write more in our main

1439
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,359
function we're going to create a Holo

1440
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,238
World okay so I'm going to start writing

1441
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,880
it and you guys tell me what's

1442
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,159
surprising about

1443
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,439
it okay now if you freaked out before

1444
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,920
now probably it's time to freak out

1445
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,799
what's okay this is um yeah different

1446
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:19,719
keybord okay so I want to say hello

1447
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:22,158
world good

1448
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,359
and and S CD blah blah and line

1449
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,520
character two lines that I'm going to

1450
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,960
add which like look probably very

1451
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,359
foreign so I'm going to say hash let me

1452
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:36,359
figure out which one is Hash here hash

1453
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:41,319
or pound include angle bracket I

1454
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,880
stream and go

1455
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,759
bracket okay oh thank you yeah stream

1456
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:55,000
yep that one work okay so any surprises

1457
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,880
pound include what does that

1458
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,440
mean well I want to print something

1459
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,800
right so

1460
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,840
just uh proper C++ has very little

1461
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,960
functionality so over time a lot of

1462
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,239
developers put together the code that

1463
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,360
was useful for their projects for many

1464
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,120
many projects and they put it into

1465
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,560
libraries and that's the point of the

1466
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,880
C++ standards committee they meet very

1467
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,719
so often and they release new updates to

1468
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,320
this libraries every four years or so

1469
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,600
and uh printing is useful so we'll

1470
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,320
probably use that pound include I stream

1471
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,320
in every assignment because we will

1472
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,400
print stuff and that's a bunch of

1473
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,159
functions so I stream is input out

1474
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,960
Stream So related to printing why do I

1475
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,440
use this angle

1476
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,400
brackets that says that it's standard

1477
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,159
Library so I could use quotes and that

1478
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:53,640
would be my own stuff to include in my

1479
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,159
my own local directory but if it's

1480
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,000
standard library then the compiler will

1481
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,040
know that it's from angle brackets so

1482
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,760
that means that whenever the compiler

1483
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,719
sees some unusual things like this C out

1484
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:09,719
or end line it look in included stuff in

1485
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,080
this case in our stream and we'll try to

1486
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,159
find what is this function C out which

1487
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,000
is standard

1488
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,080
output so to read this line you take

1489
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,679
this strain hello world and redirect it

1490
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,840
with this operator which is double less

1491
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,600
than redirected

1492
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,560
to standard out and then you also put

1493
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,360
the end of line character and also send

1494
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,880
it to standard out standard out is the

1495
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,000
line on the ter terminal right so that's

1496
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,639
the center output so there you

1497
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:50,560
go that's the sent so what's with this

1498
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,679
STD double column so there's a thing

1499
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:59,639
that is a very very bad yeah so is C++

1500
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:04,840
sensitive to SPAC system upad so or did

1501
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,120
you no like it's not it's not it's not

1502
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,639
you only put that for cl yeah

1503
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:14,440
yeah um so I could put like this I don't

1504
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,000
care I could put like this I don't oh it

1505
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,120
doesn't let you because it's a you Ed

1506
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,199
but example

1507
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:26,960
thisd yeah put here don't put uh a space

1508
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,040
between this because it's an operator

1509
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,120
yeah but over there it doesn't matter

1510
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,360
yep so don't put it between semicolon so

1511
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,679
some of them are so say this is the

1512
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,159
resolution scope operator so it's

1513
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,360
important to not put then um it'll look

1514
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,960
directly to the left directly to the

1515
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,280
right uh but let me talk about this

1516
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,440
SD double colon thing so I could say

1517
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,239
using name

1518
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,440
space

1519
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,800
STD and I would say hey compiler look at

1520
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,800
that in standard library look at the Nam

1521
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,639
space so standard library has many Nam

1522
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:11,000
spaces many regions associated with

1523
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,199
different functionalities so take this

1524
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,120
STD and bring all of the functions for

1525
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,159
use as if I were to write them myself

1526
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:24,080
that's pretty bad because then the is a

1527
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,440
potential for collisions right what if I

1528
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,040
what if somebody else will write C out

1529
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,320
for I don't know for some other purposes

1530
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,880
like this is standard this is standard

1531
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,159
output what if I want to use it for some

1532
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:40,480
something else right so there's a a a

1533
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,320
possibility for collisions and that's

1534
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,840
why this is a bad practice to bring all

1535
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,679
of the STD there but if you work then

1536
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,960
you could simplify your syntax like this

1537
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,120
because then see out and n End of Line

1538
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,719
character would be in your scope

1539
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,360
immediately from standard Library so

1540
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,560
double column is scope resolution

1541
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,960
operator and if you need to look at some

1542
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,000
user defined Scopes you use it but you

1543
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,800
can also using name spaces you can bring

1544
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,920
all of those in your

1545
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,760
local uh

1546
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,760
environment local scope is this clear so

1547
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,040
uh let me clean up clean up this things

1548
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,679
it just looks bad but okay so let me try

1549
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:29,080
to compile let's

1550
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,639
see you have this code by the

1551
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:36,159
way uh in the in

1552
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,600
your oh yeah this is where it's really

1553
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,000
hard to read

1554
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,800
right so but you have your hello world

1555
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,080
here yes no typos so I can run it and we

1556
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,400
hope to see Hello World right so it does

1557
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,440
what we expected it prints hello world

1558
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,199
two standard

1559
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,800
output okay so we're done with this

1560
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,800
right we wrote all of this except that

1561
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,679
please don't use like there's entire

1562
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,280
threads on Reddit and core core and

1563
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,120
stuff like that where um or stack

1564
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,360
Overflow where people argue why you

1565
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,000
should never use name spaces however if

1566
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,719
you know what you're doing it's fine

1567
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,400
it just be careful because then you

1568
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,960
sometimes there could be even things

1569
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,120
where a wrong function is called because

1570
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,920
of usern name spaces because of the

1571
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,159
collisions and you'll never find out so

1572
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:40,440
so it's better to do STD do semi colum

1573
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,799
colum any

1574
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,840
questions okay well I think this see out

1575
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,880
is

1576
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,320
really creepy because after that I think

1577
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,920
it'll be easier so if if you if you're

1578
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,840
fine with this it'll it'll get easier

1579
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,320
now more logical so finish is difficult

1580
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,840
I still can do not do it so will this be

1581
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,040
hard yes I told you it's a boot camp it

1582
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,159
is going to be really really hard but

1583
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:06,760
you'll love

1584
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,960
it could you also use using names space

1585
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,800
stdc out yes so that's a better practice

1586
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,800
bring only what you need to

1587
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,760
survive if you know that line uh from

1588
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,639
Space Balls Okay so

1589
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:26,480
um see out and then you would also have

1590
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,960
to include STD Colin colon and line and

1591
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,840
then you're fine you can use those so so

1592
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,880
you just Brint only the functions that

1593
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,440
you want I understand that stream has

1594
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,360
all functions as CNC out yes but why

1595
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,440
would they put them inside STD and make

1596
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,520
us use the resolution scope I don't know

1597
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,400
oh ask V he knows he's part of the guys

1598
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,719
who did it so we can ask them so does

1599
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,760
STD see out mean that you call a

1600
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,239
function called C out from Center

1601
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,679
Library class yes yes yes yes yes

1602
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,719
yes yes that's a function and then

1603
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,880
there's operators that you know just

1604
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,880
like bra all sorts of uh brackets that

1605
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,199
you could use you could redefine uh

1606
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:12,080
those operators and to do whatever you

1607
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,880
want in C++ which is really really

1608
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,320
cool okay and we'll show you how to do

1609
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,520
that now I'm going to build even more do

1610
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,480
you remember that useless class that we

1611
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,639
did in my program well it's there it

1612
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:34,080
compiles so it's a type it acts just

1613
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,080
like a type so maybe I can declare a

1614
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,000
variable of that type right with the

1615
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
value with the name a type sphere some

1616
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,679
location and garbage value right so

1617
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,280
let's see should it compile

1618
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,880
now let me write a little more according

1619
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,440
to to what we have on your um notes here

1620
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,520
we'll also write this we'll put

1621
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,400
public so we'll Define regions in the

1622
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,679
class that will do different things so

1623
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:11,120
each class

1624
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,400
in um in C++ can have three regions and

1625
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,639
let's talk just about two now public and

1626
01:18:17,639 --> 01:18:19,840
private so if you don't do it everything

1627
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,560
will be private so if you don't write it

1628
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,000
by default it will be private

1629
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,159
which means that so if everything is

1630
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,800
private that means that only functions

1631
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,600
or members of the class can use anything

1632
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,440
that's private to that class so no

1633
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,199
other

1634
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,280
things can access it so for example this

1635
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,840
a sphere and therefore main function

1636
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,600
cannot have access to private variables

1637
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,400
or

1638
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,760
functions therefore it's very important

1639
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,920
to have control and explicitly design

1640
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,040
your class so that you have public

1641
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,480
functionalities and private

1642
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,480
functionalities private functionalities

1643
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,199
are only visible inside of the class to

1644
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,280
the members themselves but then public

1645
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,719
functionalities can be used by what we

1646
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:11,080
called a client code that is this main

1647
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,320
function is in this

1648
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:18,280
case so is this clear let's see is this

1649
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,560
surprising let's see what I wanted to uh

1650
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,960
to say here on my slide

1651
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,960
yeah so we declared uh

1652
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,239
sphere a of type sphere and we defined

1653
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,280
two regions we didn't put anything there

1654
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,639
yet and that's the goal of the next

1655
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:38,320
slide and we are on the next

1656
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,759
page so now it's the design

1657
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,880
question what do you want this sphere to

1658
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,600
be so what will be the representation

1659
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,400
that is variable variables associated

1660
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,199
with this class

1661
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:56,320
and what should be the functionality do

1662
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,760
you remember we had radius as

1663
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,080
representations and color and location

1664
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,600
right so let's keep radius as

1665
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,639
representation and this is the Syntax

1666
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,360
for that and we put it in

1667
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,800
private and I have a question for you

1668
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,320
why do you think radius should be

1669
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,560
private so this means that from main

1670
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,760
function we can never access radius we

1671
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,520
can never change it is that a good

1672
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,960
choice let's think about it so what if I

1673
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,880
I still want to change radius somehow

1674
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,440
maybe right I want to have control but I

1675
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,520
want to completely control what the

1676
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,639
client will be able to do with my sphere

1677
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:41,760
so maybe if they change radius I will

1678
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,920
ask like oh what if it's negative then I

1679
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,800
will not let them do that right so I

1680
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,280
don't want the client code here directly

1681
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,560
access this radi because they may change

1682
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,000
it to something that I don't want so I

1683
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,159
want instead to provide maybe the

1684
01:20:57,159 --> 01:20:59,760
functionality see how I wrot it

1685
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,920
here maybe I want to provide the

1686
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,360
functionality

1687
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,159
instead for doing that oh

1688
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,840
yeah

1689
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,239
so maybe

1690
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:16,560
instead one of my

1691
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,520
functionalities should be being able to

1692
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,639
change the sphere

1693
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:26,719
in some way including radius right and

1694
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,920
then it's control behavior and that

1695
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,760
should go in

1696
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,199
public something that clients can do but

1697
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:37,800
my sphere representation or data will be

1698
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,679
something that I protect with private

1699
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:43,239
region so that nobody can access it and

1700
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:45,880
change it in unwanted manner right so

1701
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,480
what other functionalities do we want

1702
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,639
with spheres what would you want to know

1703
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:51,639
about the sphere

1704
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:54,639
Maybe

1705
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,920
do you want to know the radius or

1706
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,600
something else right maybe you want to

1707
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,520
know like volume or something so like

1708
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,360
get information about it get

1709
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,360
information about the sphere and here we

1710
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,080
have this um sample function get

1711
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,639
diameter for

1712
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:16,280
example so maybe we want to change this

1713
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:20,480
sphere and that will be the function set

1714
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,080
radius we might want just to create cre

1715
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,520
here as well so there's many more things

1716
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,600
that you might want to do create

1717
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,880
sphere many things that you might might

1718
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,320
want maybe you want to add spheres maybe

1719
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,400
you want to divide them in some way

1720
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,760
maybe what color them draw them print

1721
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,120
them you know many things that you might

1722
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,360
want to do but this is just for

1723
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,679
Simplicity let's start with this so I'm

1724
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,560
going to go to my code and please now

1725
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,960
see maybe I'll make some mistakes so

1726
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,360
here's functionality for

1727
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,760
creating and this is called a

1728
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,600
Constructor so this is going to create

1729
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,080
sphere so why do you know and compiler

1730
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,120
knows that it's a Constructor well it's

1731
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,239
a

1732
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,199
function with no return type you see it

1733
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,840
doesn't return anything and the name of

1734
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,560
the function is the same as the class so

1735
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,960
that's how the compiler will know that

1736
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,880
it's the Constructor that's something

1737
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,280
that will build the object um

1738
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,360
okay the object of this type now the

1739
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,080
second one was void set radius because

1740
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,199
it doesn't have to return anything we're

1741
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:40,199
just going to change the radius

1742
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:43,120
radius and we want to give a parameter

1743
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,400
or Double R

1744
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,199
right and um the last one was we want to

1745
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,880
get the diameter so we want to return

1746
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,239
type double and we want to get a

1747
01:23:58,239 --> 01:23:59,920
diameter

1748
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,400
okay so what do we want to do with this

1749
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,480
functions maybe we want to print out get

1750
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,120
diameter

1751
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,320
instead so how do we do that we created

1752
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,840
an object of type sphere a in order to

1753
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,600
access its functionalities you put a dot

1754
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,840
so it's kind of like scope resolution

1755
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,639
operating for types but for objects of

1756
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,679
that type in order to access the

1757
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:29,719
functions you need to put dot for types

1758
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:31,920
themselves like spere you need to put

1759
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,360
scope resolution double column to access

1760
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,600
uh the members but for the objects of

1761
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,600
that type you put a dot to access the

1762
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,080
members so I can say get diameter and

1763
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,679
that way I will print

1764
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:49,080
out the diameter of the

1765
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,360
sphere does this look good so we created

1766
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,199
functionalities creating a

1767
01:24:54,199 --> 01:25:00,480
sphere change sphere change it and get

1768
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,880
information get

1769
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,199
information about

1770
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,159
it so I'm going to compile

1771
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,920
[Music]

1772
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,760
it doesn't like it I have a question for

1773
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,280
you I'm going to this is

1774
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,000
the moment for you to answer why does

1775
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,760
that H why did that

1776
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,600
happen why doesn't it compile yeah we

1777
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,600
didn't Define the function for we

1778
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,639
actually didn't give the code to run

1779
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:41,960
those functions right we only declared

1780
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,920
them right we only declared the

1781
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,639
functionalities we didn't give the

1782
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,679
provide the code to build that is it

1783
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:51,440
unable yeah that's why it's complain yep

1784
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,600
I honestly did not no it only has

1785
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,920
functions declarations not

1786
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,159
implementation do you see that we

1787
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:01,199
prescribed to set radius of this value

1788
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:04,520
but we didn't tell how there's no code

1789
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,760
right H okay good good good good so we

1790
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,080
have to write the code right but um

1791
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,520
let's do it but I think I want to say

1792
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,480
something about this line

1793
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,280
though do so so what what does it do

1794
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,679
when I

1795
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,320
declare a variable of T sphere what is

1796
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,280
this here what is the value of it then

1797
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,840
we know that it's garbage right but

1798
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,600
what's the location how does the

1799
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,040
compiler know what to even do do you

1800
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,760
have does anybody

1801
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,760
know or can take

1802
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,239
guess

1803
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:55,679
so we actually have control some control

1804
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,159
of what's going to happen upon

1805
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:59,840
Declaration of that sphere and this is

1806
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,800
the line when you declare this sphere

1807
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,080
here this is where a

1808
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,080
Constructor is called so this function

1809
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,679
that we just wrote or declared but

1810
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:15,960
didn't Define so this

1811
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:20,400
Constructor is called so before we wrote

1812
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,119
this

1813
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:23,960
function a default Constructor was

1814
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,520
called and that default Constructor did

1815
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,400
nothing right but you have control you

1816
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,000
can actually write your own construction

1817
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,440
and you can then prescribe what should

1818
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,199
happen at that moment okay so that's uh

1819
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,719
something to remember we'll talk about

1820
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:41,239
Constructors much more later but that's

1821
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:43,119
something to remember that over here

1822
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:45,360
something important happens and if you

1823
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,520
were to actually write the Constructor

1824
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,159
and you would um put a print out

1825
01:27:51,159 --> 01:27:52,679
statement of some sort sort in your

1826
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:55,840
Constructor here after this line it

1827
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,159
would print out whatever you put

1828
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,320
whatever you say so let's write these

1829
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,040
functions okay let's write them H where

1830
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,639
do oh wait sorry we need to

1831
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:10,880
also put the representation ofhere right

1832
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,119
with

1833
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:15,119
radius

1834
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,679
okay okay so now I'm going to write my

1835
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:22,719
functions so which as we're going to

1836
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,840
write let's write set radius and get

1837
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,639
diameter and we'll leave out we'll keep

1838
01:28:27,639 --> 01:28:30,480
the default Constructor for now so I'm

1839
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,440
going to write this function

1840
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,520
avoid H

1841
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,880
sphere so you already know this scope

1842
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,840
resolution operator because otherwise

1843
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,719
the compiler will not know which set

1844
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,400
radius is it we need to actually say

1845
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,360
that this is the sphere set radius that

1846
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:52,239
we're going to define Double R so so far

1847
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:56,440
I wrote the signature of this

1848
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,960
function okay so this signature and

1849
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:05,719
let's uh go please actually

1850
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:14,639
yeah or sphere yeah it's outside yeah so

1851
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,360
very very good this is something that

1852
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,320
can be written in many ways and write it

1853
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,360
in one way but there's three ways to

1854
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,920
write definitions of the functions so

1855
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,360
I'm going to write it outside of the

1856
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,520
sphere class

1857
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,520
definition and now explain why in a bit

1858
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,360
but let's first try it so if it's

1859
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,440
outside then it's not clear if I would

1860
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,440
not write the sphere double column it

1861
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,560
wouldn't be clear which set radius it is

1862
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,320
because there may be balls with set

1863
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,080
radius and maybe some other things that

1864
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,280
will want to set the radius as well so

1865
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,920
it's very important out if you're

1866
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,480
outside of that class to Define which

1867
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,400
scope this radius belongs to and this is

1868
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,480
the signature of this function the

1869
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,719
return type the parameter type and the

1870
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,440
name and the scope right but now we'll

1871
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,960
actually write down what it should do so

1872
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,960
what should you do if you set the radius

1873
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,920
you just say Okay this private member

1874
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,800
radius is equal to

1875
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,840
R and remember private members can only

1876
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,560
be accessed by the

1877
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,639
members of the class itself so this is

1878
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,639
the m radius function is the member of

1879
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,960
the class so it can U access radius and

1880
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,520
change it that's good so this is where

1881
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,239
you could also put a state if statement

1882
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,440
like if radius is greater than zero so

1883
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,080
you could control how the client is

1884
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,760
going to set this radius and that it's

1885
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,600
proper okay and now let's write the

1886
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,840
function signature for get diameter so

1887
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,400
double

1888
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:58,600
scope scope resolution operator get

1889
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,760
diameter and now the actual

1890
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,480
implementation so curly braces or curly

1891
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,840
brackets and what do you want

1892
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,480
return two times radius again we can

1893
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,880
access the private member because this

1894
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:20,040
is the member function okay so now

1895
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,520
hopefully we should get some diameter to

1896
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,600
be printed

1897
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,520
out and hopefully there will be no

1898
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,400
compilation errors let's

1899
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:34,760
check no compilation errors we run the

1900
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,920
program zero why is

1901
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,880
that ah because of the Constructor The

1902
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,119
Constructor actually does nothing right

1903
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:46,840
we rely on default constructure so

1904
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,280
default constructure does nothing it

1905
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,320
doesn't assign any radius to the sphere

1906
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,920
let's write a

1907
01:31:54,199 --> 01:31:56,280
Constructor do you want to write a

1908
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,560
Constructor I don't think I have that in

1909
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,239
my slides so this is a little bit

1910
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:08,480
of um so let's set radius

1911
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,520
to equals 10 that's my that's my

1912
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,360
construct it's really silly right it

1913
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,400
really doesn't do much nothing

1914
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,719
interesting or useful or even meaningful

1915
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,760
right but that's what it is so what do

1916
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,480
we expect

1917
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,040
now what's the

1918
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,800
output diameter 20 yay so do you see now

1919
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,480
that we defined and sorry in the in the

1920
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,400
slides I don't have definition of the

1921
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,920
Constructor but it's just another line

1922
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,880
for defining the in the same way with

1923
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,440
the function signature of the

1924
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,679
Constructor and what it has to

1925
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:50,639
do and now it's very clear for you guys

1926
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,440
right that in this main function here

1927
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,520
the Constructor is called and now it

1928
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,560
assigns radius to

1929
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,159
10 that's good and then we call get

1930
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,080
diameter actually I could even

1931
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,480
maybe set the diameter to something else

1932
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,360
now so I could say

1933
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,760
a or set radius set radius

1934
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,000
to

1935
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,560
five and let's do a double so that

1936
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,239
there's no I don't want to deal with

1937
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:25,119
cast yet we'll talk about it

1938
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,400
later and now what should be the

1939
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:33,599
output 10

1940
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:36,440
okay okay so we use all three

1941
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,360
functionalities of our

1942
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,440
class

1943
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,080
object because we Define them so well

1944
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,440
right so let's go back to our slides I

1945
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,520
think I had some questions so we can

1946
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,560
answer them

1947
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,440
um let's answer them and then I'll

1948
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,600
finish so can and should aliases for

1949
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,000
important functions be

1950
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,520
used this is let's let's not do this

1951
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,880
now

1952
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,639
because um we're jumping ahead so we

1953
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,719
we'll talk about this kind of syntax

1954
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,480
later when it's more appropriate

1955
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,480
right

1956
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,560
not to be altered by users

1957
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,440
directly oh I don't understand wasn't

1958
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,760
response to why theid should be private

1959
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,080
oh right right right yeah yeah do did I

1960
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,880
answer all okay or is there yeah

1961
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,400
okay sorry sometimes um it's difficult

1962
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,400
to follow the questions and so just ask

1963
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,679
again if I didn't answer it right okay

1964
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:53,159
so so I want to conclude because I think

1965
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:55,679
we're running out out of time so now

1966
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,880
I'll if you look at your slides I think

1967
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,199
it's not very clear at your printouts

1968
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,719
that there but it's clear that there are

1969
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,560
three cases three cases of writing these

1970
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,520
definitions of the functions one was

1971
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:13,199
just the way I just did uh in in my file

1972
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,560
so bringing the definitions of functions

1973
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,560
outside of the class you like

1974
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,679
it or does it feel like this is

1975
01:35:24,679 --> 01:35:27,199
weird Okay let me show you the

1976
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,199
second the second case is actually doing

1977
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:32,280
the same thing so instead of these two

1978
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,199
lines here I brought whatever was in

1979
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,880
curly braces and put them right here

1980
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,000
after the Declaration so like putting

1981
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,719
the Declaration of the functionalities

1982
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,960
together with implementation right there

1983
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,080
inside the do you like it

1984
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,679
better yes yes is more

1985
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,119
common the most common is number three

1986
01:35:56,119 --> 01:35:59,119
so the number three is

1987
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,639
this putl them in three files have your

1988
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,360
main function here put the definitions

1989
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,080
in what's called sphere

1990
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,159
CPP so that's the definitions of member

1991
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:14,000
functionalities and

1992
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,080
put your signatures only which is called

1993
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,199
an interface to the F in spere

1994
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:23,719
that's what we'll be using all along

1995
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:25,280
that's what everybody

1996
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,360
does do you like it like seems like the

1997
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,440
worst thing right but it's actually very

1998
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,719
important for encapsulation so let me

1999
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:35,480
just give you a hint why and then we'll

2000
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,840
start you this later so the thing is

2001
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:42,560
that you can hide your Genius code of

2002
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,080
implementation and sell just the

2003
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,000
interfaces to the client to

2004
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,760
use together with objects that you

2005
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,320
pre-compile using your smart code so you

2006
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,280
never actually Reveal Your codes but you

2007
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,520
can sell your product like that for

2008
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,119
people to use and that's called in

2009
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,760
capsulation so you really hide your proi

2010
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,639
and

2011
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:09,679
stuff uh unfortunately if you use

2012
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,920
templates you cannot do that so people

2013
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,000
love templates but then you canot hide

2014
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,800
stuff so but but if you don't use templ

2015
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,000
templates are really useful so they

2016
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,880
Implement polymorphism and all of that

2017
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,840
but

2018
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,159
um but this is a very common thing to do

2019
01:37:25,159 --> 01:37:27,679
if you really want to write them your

2020
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:34,159
code here and sell only uh object and uh

2021
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,760
interfaces okay next time we'll start

2022
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:40,360
right there so we'll go through this

2023
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000

2048
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,960
exciting yeah yeah I'm I can't believe

2049
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,440
it's happening

2050
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,800
and the attend attendance is not

2051
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,080
mandatory not for lectures not for labs

2052
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,800
nothing yeah everything can be competed

2053
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,679
online if you want that's good have the

2054
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:34,560
lecture at the same

2055
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,560
stab that's why we don't have many

2056
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,560
students but like here physically but we

2057
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,480
want we want you to be able to

2058
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,000
completely do it online although we'll

2059
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,520
miss nice to have physical lectures too

2060
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:52,159
well thank you for the lecture you you

2061
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:56,400
okay hey I think there might be a

2062
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,239
problem with

2063
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,400
the I don't think they have the

2064
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:04,159
environments

2065
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,599
here they should use their

2066
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:11,719
laptops yeah oh right so they'll have to

2067
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:13,840
go through

2068
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,760
setup no we all have to go have to yeah

2069
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,760
because you'll they you'll need to log

2070
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:26,719
them in with your Ro password

2071
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,360
yeah yep at least I think that is

2072
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,280
necessary I think there will be see you

2073
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:39,400
sell anything there that ad

2074
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,239
maybe see if I can

2075
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,920
likeall yes maybe I can they like ited

2076
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,520
for

2077
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,639
today I know but hey I think it's going

2078
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:55,000
to be okay because you know the toughest

2079
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,480
Will Survive and they can do it on their

2080
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,920
laptops and if not like the rest will

2081
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,639
take it next year where we are more

2082
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,360
prepared because yeah I don't know what

2083
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,159
to expect like Steve is like why didn't

2084
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:07,599
you say last week that you want bigger

2085
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:09,800
lectures but last week you only had 100

2086
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,400
students and then this is almost fine

2087
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,679
right I I mean I I think it's going to

2088
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:17,320
be fine from like how like usually a

2089
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,480
small percentage of students actually

2090
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,040
attend

2091
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,800
way

2092
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,639
so you know what what really frustrates

2093
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,199
me the most it's 2hour lectures it's

2094
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:32,360
just like impossible to remember that

2095
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,400
much material this lectures were one

2096
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,000
hour at a time it's so much easier like

2097
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,599
one hour you can really remember the

2098
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:41,960
story two hours

2099
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,840
oh

2100
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:06,500
[Laughter]

2101
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,080
yeah
